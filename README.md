#### _A page with toggling javascript definitions_

#### By _**Scott Hutley and Erica Marroquin**_

## Technologies Used

* html
* bootstrap
* css
* javascript
* jQuery

## Description

_This page offers a listing of javascript vocabulary that will display the definition when clicking on each word. Each new word clicked displays the definition that applies to that word and hides the previous definition._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to an empty folder or to your desktop. Instructions for cloning can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).
* Navigate to index.html within the folder and open with your web browser.

## Known Bugs

* This is still a WIP so the vocabulary options are limited and the definitions contain only placeholder text.
* Currently the only way a new definition will populate is to click on a different word. There is no option to simply hide or toggle the previous definition without bringing up a new one (aside from refreshing the entire page).
